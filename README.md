## Added feature: Finds and displays all exact pairs in the player's hand
* It loops through the player's cards, and sorts out which ones match
* When a match is found, they are displayed under the cards that loosely match
* Raised cards dealt to 26, and added a forced pair of spades, to ensure the feature worked, and to raise the chance of another pair being present
